     *      Which three statments describe the object-oriented features of the java language?
     * 
     *      a) Object can be reused.
     *      b) A Subclass can inherit from a superclass.
     *      c) Objects can share behaviors with other objects.
     *      d) A package must contain more than one class.
     *      e) Object is the root class of all other objects.
     *      f) A main method must be declared in every class.
     * 
     * 
     * 
     *      Option a, the object is reusable.
     *      Option b, subclass (class) can of course inherit the parent class (otherwise how there will be a parent-child relationship).
     *      With option c, objects can share behavior with other objects via static (class) methods, the same parent class methods, or interface methods.
     *
